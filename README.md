### Project Description

The goal of this tool is to help election officials identify optimal sites for potential Vote Center and Vote-by-Mail drop boxes. The tool uses a facility allocation model that incorporates the siting criteria included in the California Voter's Choice Act. The resulting interactive web maps are intended to supplement what election officials and stakeholders already know about their counties' profiles and needs.

This project was picked up from DataKind for the 2020 election cycle update. We will expand the number of California counties, add 15 Colorado Counties, and add 1 county in Texas and Arizona.
